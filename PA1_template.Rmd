1 - Reading the data from the “activity.csv”

data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",", na.strings = "NA")

2 - Looking at a summary for the dataset using “summary” and “str” methods:

summary(data)

3 - Looking at the first 6 rows of the dataset:

head(data)

4 - Converting the “date” variable to a Date classe and the “interval” variable to a factor:

data$date <- as.Date(data$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
data$interval <- factor(data$interval)

What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

1 - Subsitting the dataset to ignore missing values

NA_index <- is.na(as.character(data$steps))
data_no_NA <- data[!NA_index,]
head(data_no_NA)


2 - Aggregating the number of steps taken each day:

#Creating a data frame with the steps taken for each day
steps_each_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data = data_no_NA, sum)
#Adding column names to the created data frame
colnames(steps_each_day) <- c("date", "steps")

3 - Making a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day:

hist(as.numeric(steps_each_day$steps), breaks = 20, col = "red", xlab = "Number of Steps", main= "Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day")


What is the average daily activity pattern?

1 - Calculating the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days:

#Calculating the average
steps_per_interval <- aggregate(data_no_NA$steps, by=list(interval=data_no_NA$interval), FUN=mean)

#Adding columns names
colnames(steps_per_interval) <- c("interval", "average_steps")

#ploting the average daily activity pattern 
plot(as.integer(levels(steps_per_interval$interval)), steps_per_interval$average_steps, type="l",
     xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Average Number of Steps", main = "Average Daily Activity Pattern",  col ="blue")


2 - The 5-minute interval that contains the maximum number of steps:

#The maximum number of average steps
max_steps <- max(steps_per_interval$average_steps)
max_steps



2 - The 5-minute interval that contains the maximum number of steps:

#The maximum number of average steps
max_steps <- max(steps_per_interval$average_steps)
max_steps
